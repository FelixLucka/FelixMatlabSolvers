- write introduction to all Test scripts
- StochasticProximalGradientDescent: figure out where you had the implementations 
from and why SAHRA, STORM do not work anymore
- unify output in optimization methods
- rename all options etc following new schema
- turn variable recast into script block
- rename nu to step_size
- find good parameters for example_image_reconstruction_optical_flow_estimation
